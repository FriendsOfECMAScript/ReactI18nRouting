## Why?
There are robust solutions that they have become in standard solutions to usual problems in *React* ecosystem such as
**internalization** with *React-Intl* and **routing** with *React-Router*.
There are awesome libraries that they make our life more easy building apps but, what happens when we need to combine
two parts in our projects? In this case we think that some other library is needed to join the routing and i18n systems
so, we have created the ReactI18nRouting.

This library aims to provide all the needed to make the internationalization of the routes as easy as possible.
We truly trust in the **Single Responsibility Pattern** so, we have designed the library following the UNIX popular
concept:<br>*DOTADIW, or "Do One Thing and Do It Well"*.

## Installation
The recommended and the most suitable way to install is through *Yarn*.
```shell
$ yarn add @foes/react-i18n-routing
```
Or alternatively, through *NPM*.
```shell
$ npm install --save @foes/react-i18n-routing
```  

## Documentation
All the documentation is stored in the `docs` folder.

## Contributing
This library follows the modern JavaScript coding standards, so pull requests need to pass the [ESLint][1] and
[Prettier][2]. This task can be very boring but, in the `package.json` there are some useful
npm-scripts that becomes this process simpler and faster.
```bash
$ yarn cs           # or npm run cs
```
There is also a policy for contributing to this library. Pull requests must be explained step by step to make the
review process easy in order to accept and merge them. New methods or code improvements must come paired with
tests. We are using [Jest][3] test framework for that purpose.
```bash
$ yarn test         # or npm test
```
